"""
Detection is run in three steps:

1. 2D filtering
2. 3D filtering
3. Structure detection

In steps 1. and 2. filters are applied, and any bright points detected
post-filter are marked. To avoid using a separate mask array to mark the
bright points, the input data is clipped to [0, (max_val - 2)]
(max_val is the maximum value that the image data type can store), and:
- (max_val - 1) is used to mark bright points during 2D filtering
- (max_val) is used to mark bright points during 3D filtering
