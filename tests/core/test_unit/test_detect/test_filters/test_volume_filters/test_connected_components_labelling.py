    Test for `connect_four` with a rectangular plane (2-to-1 length ratio)
    containing a checkerboard of pixels marked as cells ("structures").
    The choice of the checkerboard pattern ensure the minimal number of pixels
    are used to execute this test (because all cell-pixels are disconnected).
    The parameters are designed to bridge the max unsigned 16-bit integer.
    When the maximum is reached, tests are expected to fail with uint16 input.

    We check that
    * the checkerboard has the expected number of structures
    * there is exactly one structure with id 1
    * there is exactly one structure with the maximum id...
    * ...and that structure is in the expected place (top-right pixel)
